### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE<br>
#### This assessment will attempt to answer two questions:<br>

>  1. Is there a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along Boston's Charles river and those that are not?<br>
>  2. Is it possible to accurately predict the median house price in Boston?<br><br>
To determine whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between those that are along the Charles river and those that are not, I will utilize inferential statistics.
I will use keras to aid me in building a neural network to see if I can accurately predict the median house price.
***

The project will be broken into 3 sections:

Section 1 : A general description of the Boston House Price dataset with the use of some descriptive statistics and plots.<br><br>
Section 2 : To find out if there is a significant difference between the median price of a house along the Charles river and houses that are not through the use of inferential statistics.<br><br>
Section 3 : To create a method that will allow the prediction of the median home price utilizing keras.<br><br>

These are the steps I will take in building my prediction model:

1.Scale the data.<br>
2.Build the model utilizing a neural network and adding layers.<br>
3.Split the dataset into training and test groups.<br>
4.Train the neural network model.<br>
5.Predict the median house value.<br>
6.Evaluate the results.<br>

I will use these steps to build a model to predict the medv while using all the other variables and also use the medv to predict the medv using just three variables.

All this will be done with the use of the Boston House Prices dataset.
