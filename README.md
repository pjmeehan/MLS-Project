### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE<br>
#### This assessment will attempt to answer two questions:<br>

>  1.Is there a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along Boston's Charles river and those that are not?
>  2.Is it possible to accurately predict the median house price in Boston?<br>
To determine whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between those that are along the Charles river and those that are not, I will utilize inferential statistics.
I will use keras to aid me in building a neural network to see if I can accurately predict the median house price.

The project will be broken into 3 sections:

Section 1 : A general description of the Boston House Price dataset with the use of some descriptive statistics and plots.
Section 2 : To find out if there is a significant difference between the median price of a house along the Charles river and houses that are not through the use of inferential statistics.
Section 3 : To create a method that will allow the prediction of the median home price utilizing keras.

All this will be done with the use of the BostonHouse Prices dataset.
